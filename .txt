If the problems is [runzeli@login1 ~]$ls
bash: ls: command not found...
Similar command is: 'lz'
===t appears the shell still can't find the ls command. This might happen if the PATH variable was completely overridden in your shell, causing the ls command (located in /bin or /usr/bin) to be unavailable.

Try using the absolute path of ls directly:


## code
/bin/ls
or
## code
/usr/bin/ls
If this works, that means the system can find the ls command, but your PATH environment variable still does not include the directory where ls resides.

To temporarily restore your PATH variable, you can reset it to a more standard value:


###Solutions is below


export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
